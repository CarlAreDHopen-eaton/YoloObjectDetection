# Yolo Object Detector
This project contains a .NET library and application to detect object in an RTSP video stream using a Yolo model, ML.NET and OpenCV.
This is a work in progress. 

- The Yolov4 implementation works 
- The YoloV2 implementation in incomplete and does not yet work

Due to file size restrictions here in Github I have not included the ONNX models in the repo.
